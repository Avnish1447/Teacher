Excellent. The "Two Sum" problem is a classic rite of passage. It's the perfect place to begin our work. Let's transform this puzzle into simple wisdom.

-----

### Clarify the Goal

First, let's make sure we're on the same page. The problem gives us a list of numbers (an array) and a single `target` number. Our job is to find exactly two numbers in that list which, when added together, equal the `target`. Once we find them, we don't return the numbers themselves, but their *positions* (or indices) in the original list.

Is that understanding correct? We're hunting for the positions of two numbers that sum up to our target.

-----

### The Analogy First: The Costume Party

Imagine you're at a costume party. Every guest has a number pinned to their back. You're given a special `target` number, let's say `100`. Your mission is to find a pair of guests whose numbers add up to `100`.

You could go about this in a very slow way, but let's think of a cleverer method. You have a notepad. As you meet each guest, you do two things:

1.  **Look for your partner:** Let's say you're guest number `30`. You know you need to find a guest with the number `70` (`100 - 30`). You quickly glance at your notepad. Is "guest `70`" already on your list? If yes, you've found your match\! Mission accomplished.
2.  **Jot down your number:** If guest `70` isn't on your list, you jot down your own number (`30`) and where you are standing in the room (your `index`) on the notepad. Why? So that when guest `70` comes along later, they can look at the notepad and find you\!

You then move to the next guest and repeat the process. This "notepad" is the core of our efficient solution.

-----

### Brute Force Idea

Now, think about the most obvious, straightforward way to solve this at the party. You'd probably pick one guest, say guest `30`, and then walk around the entire room asking every single other guest, "Is your number `70`?". If you find them, great. If not, you'd then move to the *second* guest, say number `45`, and again, walk around the entire room asking everyone else, "Is your number `55`?".

This would work, but it's terribly slow\! For a party with `N` guests, you might have to ask almost `N` questions for each of the `N` guests. This is inefficient and, frankly, not a very fun way to enjoy a party.

-----

### The Optimal Approach (The "Aha\!" Moment)

Let's use our clever "notepad" analogy to solve `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` with `target = 9`.

Our notepad (which we'll call `seen_numbers`) is currently empty: `{}`.

1.  We meet the first guest, number `2` at position `0`.

      * What number do we need for our partner? `target (9) - current_number (2) = 7`.
      * We check our notepad. Is `7` on the list? No, the notepad is empty.
      * So, what's our next move, according to the analogy?

    > *Pause for your thought... you'd jot your own number down, right?*

    Exactly\! We add our number and position to the notepad. Notepad is now: `{2: 0}`.

2.  We move to the next guest, number `7` at position `1`.

      * What number do we need for our partner? `target (9) - current_number (7) = 2`.
      * We check our notepad. Is `2` on the list?

    > *Take a look at our notepad: `{2: 0}`. What do you see?*

    Yes, it is\! We found our partner. The number `2` is on our list, and the notepad tells us it's at position `0`. We are currently at position `1`. We have found the pair\! Our result is `[0, 1]`.

The "Aha\!" moment is realizing that we only need to walk through the list of guests *once*. Each guest provides a chance to either complete a pair or to become a potential partner for a future guest.

### Code Implementation

Here is how this logic looks in Python. Notice how the comments connect directly back to our party analogy.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    """
    Finds two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target.

    Args:
        nums: A list of integers.
        target: The target integer sum.

    Returns:
        A list containing the indices of the two numbers.
    """
    # This is our "notepad" to store numbers we've seen and their positions.
    # It stores key-value pairs like {number: position}
    seen_numbers = {}

    # We go through the list of guests (numbers) one by one.
    # 'enumerate' handily gives us both the position (index) and the guest (num).
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # For each guest, we calculate the number of the partner we need.
        # e.g., if target is 9 and our number is 2, we need a 7.
        complement = target - num

        # We check our notepad to see if our needed partner has been seen before.
        if complement in seen_numbers:
            # If they are on the list, we've found our pair!
            # We return their position (from the notepad) and our current position.
            return [seen_numbers[complement], index]

        # If we didn't find a partner, we add ourselves to the notepad.
        # This is so a future guest who needs us can find us.
        # We store our number and our current position.
        seen_numbers[num] = index

    # The problem guarantees a solution exists, so we don't need a final return here.
```

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity: $O(n)$**
    In our analogy, we only had to walk past each guest one time. We never had to loop back and re-check everyone. If the number of guests (`n`) doubles, our work only doubles. This beautifully efficient, linear relationship is called **$O(n)$**.

  * **Space Complexity: $O(n)$**
    Our notepad's size depends on the number of guests. In the worst-case scenario, we might have to add almost every guest to our notepad before we find a match at the very end. Therefore, the memory (space) required grows with the number of guests (`n`). This is called **$O(n)$** space.

### Final Check

We turned a slow, repetitive search into a quick, one-pass lookup by using a "notepad" to remember what we've seen. Does this entire process, from the party analogy to the code, make sense to you?

We can also explore what might happen with edge cases, like an input of `[3, 3]` and a target of `6`, if you'd like.
