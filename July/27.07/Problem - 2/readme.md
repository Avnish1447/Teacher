Of course. Inverting a binary tree is a classic problem that beautifully illustrates the power and elegance of recursion.

-----

### Clarify the Goal

The task is to take a binary tree and create its mirror image. For every single node in the tree, we need to swap its left child with its right child. The final result is the same tree, but flipped horizontally.

So, our mission is to visit every node and have it swap its left and right branches. Does that sound right?

### The Analogy First: The Mirrored Dance Routine

Imagine you're a dance choreographer for a large group arranged in a tree formation. You want to teach them a "mirrored" version of their routine.

Instead of yelling instructions at everyone, you give one simple command to the **lead dancer** (`root`):

1.  **Swap your two lead followers.** (The dancer's left-hand and right-hand followers switch places).

Then you give a second, crucial command:
2\.  **Now, tell both of your followers to give these exact same two commands to *their* own followers.**

This "swap and delegate" command ripples through the entire dance troupe. The command cascades from one dancer to the next, and by the time it reaches the end of the lines, the entire formation has been perfectly mirrored without you having to talk to anyone but the lead dancer.

-----

### The Naive Approach

An iterative method using a queue (like in a breadth-first search) is a common alternative. You'd start with a queue containing just the root node. Then you'd loop: pull a node from the queue, swap its children, and then add its children (if they exist) to the queue.

In our analogy, this is like the choreographer keeping a to-do list of dancers to talk to. It works, but it's less elegant than the simple, cascading "swap and delegate" command that propagates naturally through the group.

-----

### The Optimal Approach (The "Aha\!" Moment)

The "Mirrored Dance Routine" is the optimal, recursive approach. The "Aha\!" moment is realizing that a complex, tree-wide operation can be achieved by defining a simple, local action on just one node and letting recursion apply that action everywhere else.

The process is simply:

1.  If the current node is empty, do nothing. This is the **base case** (a dancer with no followers).
2.  If the node exists, swap its left and right children.
3.  Then, command the left child to run this same process.
4.  Command the right child to run this same process.

That's it. The magic of recursion handles the rest.

### Code Implementation

This recursive strategy translates into exceptionally clean and simple code.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        # Base Case: If we are at an empty spot (a dancer with no followers), there's nothing to do.
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # The core command: Swap the left and right children.
        # A dancer swaps their two lead followers.
        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left
        
        # The delegation step: Command each follower to do the same routine.
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)
        
        # Return the root of the now-inverted tree.
        return root
```

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
    In our dance analogy, every dancer (`node`) in the formation must hear and perform the "swap" command exactly once. Therefore, the total work is directly proportional to the number of nodes, `N`.

  * **Space Complexity:** $O(H)$
    The memory used is not for storing data, but for the recursion itself (the call stack). The chain of "delegated commands" can go as deep as the tree is tall. This depth is the tree's **height (`H`)**. For a well-balanced tree, this is $O(\\log N)$, but for a skewed tree, it could be $O(N)$ in the worst case.

### Final Check

By defining a simple "swap and delegate" rule for a single node, we can recursively mirror the entire tree with very little code. Does this "mirrored dance routine" analogy make the solution clear?
