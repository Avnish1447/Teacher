Excellent. This is a fantastic problem for understanding how a simple change in perspective can turn a slow solution into a lightning-fast one.

### Clarify the Goal

First, let's simplify the mission. We're given a list of daily stock prices. Our goal is to find the best possible profit from a single transaction, which involves buying on one day and selling on a *future* day. If it's impossible to make a profit (i.e., the prices only go down), then our profit is zero.

The key rule is **buy low, sell high**, and the "buy" day must come before the "sell" day. Is that understanding correct?

### The Analogy First: The Time-Traveling Shopper üõçÔ∏è

Imagine you have a list of a hot new gadget's price for every day of the next month. You want to buy it once and sell it once to make the most money.

You decide to travel through time, day by day, from the start of the month to the end. As you do, you only need to keep two things in your head:

1.  **The Rock-Bottom Price:** This is the absolute cheapest price you've seen *up to the current day*. You update this number in your memory whenever you see an even lower price.
2.  **The Maximum Profit Seen:** This is the biggest profit you *could have* made so far.

On any given day, you ask yourself: "If I sell today, what's my profit?" You calculate this by taking today's price and subtracting the "Rock-Bottom Price" you're remembering. If this new profit is bigger than the "Maximum Profit Seen" in your memory, you update your memory. By the time you reach the end of the month, the "Maximum Profit Seen" in your head is your final answer.

### The Brute Force Idea

The most obvious approach is to check every possible combination. You'd say, "What if I buy on Day 1?" and then you'd check the profit for selling on Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and so on. Then you'd repeat the whole process: "What if I buy on Day 2?" and check against Day 3, Day 4, etc.

In our analogy, this is like making a huge, messy chart of every possible buy-sell pair. It works, but it's very slow ($O(N^2)$) because you're doing a lot of redundant calculations. The Time-Traveling Shopper is much more efficient.

### The Optimal Approach (The "Aha\!" Moment)

The "Time-Traveling Shopper" analogy *is* the optimal approach. The "Aha\!" moment is realizing that for any given "sell" day, the best possible profit is always determined by the absolute lowest "buy" price that came **before** it. We don't need to check against all previous days, only the minimum one.

Let's trace this with `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`:

  * We'll start with `rock_bottom_price = infinity` and `max_profit = 0`.

| Day | Price | Rock-Bottom Price So Far | Potential Profit (Price - Rock Bottom) | Max Profit So Far |
| :-- | :---- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| 1   | 7     | 7                        | 7 - 7 = 0                              | 0                 |
| 2   | 1     | **1** (New low\!)         | 1 - 1 = 0                              | 0                 |
| 3   | 5     | 1                        | 5 - 1 = 4                              | **4** (New max\!)  |
| 4   | 3     | 1                        | 3 - 1 = 2                              | 4                 |
| 5   | 6     | 1                        | 6 - 1 = 5                              | **5** (New max\!)  |
| 6   | 4     | 1                        | 4 - 1 = 3                              | 5                 |

After our one trip through time, the final answer is `5`.

### Code Implementation

This simple, one-pass logic results in very clean and efficient code.

```python
import math

class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # This is the "Rock-Bottom Price" we've seen so far.
        # We start it at infinity so any real price will be lower.
        min_price_so_far = float('inf')
        
        # This is the "Maximum Profit Seen" so far.
        max_profit = 0
        
        # We travel through time, day by day.
        for current_price in prices:
            # First, we check if today's price is a new rock-bottom price.
            if current_price < min_price_so_far:
                min_price_so_far = current_price
            
            # Then, we calculate the potential profit if we sold today.
            potential_profit = current_price - min_price_so_far
            
            # Finally, we check if this is the best profit we've seen yet.
            if potential_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = potential_profit
                
        return max_profit

```

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
    Our Time-Traveling Shopper makes exactly one pass through the list of `N` days. The work is directly proportional to the size of the input, which is very efficient.

  * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    We only ever need to store two variables (`min_price_so_far` and `max_profit`), regardless of how long the price list is. This is constant space.

### Final Check

By making a single pass through the prices while only remembering the lowest price seen so far, we can instantly calculate the maximum possible profit at each step. Does this "Time-Traveling Shopper" analogy make the solution feel simple and clear?
