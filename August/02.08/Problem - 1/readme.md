Of course. This is a great problem for practicing string manipulation and comparison.

### Clarify the Goal

The task is to compare two strings of the same length alphabetically. The key rule is that the comparison must be **case-insensitive**, meaning an uppercase letter is treated as identical to its lowercase version (e.g., 'A' is the same as 'a'). We need to output `-1` if the first string is lexicographically smaller, `1` if it's larger, and `0` if they are equal under these rules.

### The Analogy First: The Uniform-Wearing Soldiers üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Imagine you're a drill sergeant with two soldiers whose names you need to compare alphabetically: `Alex` and `abner`. Their name tags are a mix of cases, which is confusing.

To simplify, you issue a standard command: **"Everyone, put on your standard-issue lowercase uniform\!"**

  * `Alex` becomes `alex`.
  * `abner` becomes `abner`.

Now, comparing them is simple. You look at the first letter ('a' vs 'a'), then the second ('l' vs 'b'). Ah, 'b' comes before 'l'. Therefore, "abner" comes before "alex". The easiest way to compare is to make them uniform first.

### The Optimal Approach (The "Aha\!" Moment)

The "Uniform-Wearing Soldiers" analogy is the most direct and optimal way to solve this. The "Aha\!" moment is realizing that instead of comparing characters one-by-one and handling the case conversion manually each time, you can just convert both strings entirely to a standard case (like lowercase) at the beginning. Once they are "in uniform," you can use the programming language's built-in string comparison, which is fast and reliable.

Let's trace the example `s1 = "abs"` and `s2 = "Abz"`:

1.  **Standardize:** Convert both to lowercase.
      * `s1` becomes `"abs"`.
      * `s2` becomes `"abz"`.
2.  **Compare:** Now perform a standard lexicographical comparison on the new strings.
      * `"abs" < "abz"` is true because at the third character, `'s'` comes before `'z'`.
3.  **Result:** The first string is less than the second, so the output is **-1**.

### Code Implementation

The code for this approach is very concise in Python.

```python
def solve():
    """
    Solves the "Petya and Strings" problem from Codeforces.
    """
    # Read the two strings from input.
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()

    # --- The Uniform-Wearing Soldiers Analogy ---

    # 1. Put both strings in the same "lowercase uniform".
    s1_lower = s1.lower()
    s2_lower = s2.lower()

    # 2. Perform the comparison.
    if s1_lower < s2_lower:
        print("-1")
    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:
        print("1")
    else:
        print("0")

solve()
```

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(L)$, where `L` is the length of the strings. This is because both converting a string to lowercase and comparing two strings take time proportional to their length.
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(L)$. When we create the lowercase versions of the strings, we use extra memory proportional to their length.

### Final Check

This problem is a simple test of case-insensitive comparison. By standardizing the strings to one case first, the comparison becomes trivial. Does this approach make sense?
