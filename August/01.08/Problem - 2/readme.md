Of course. This is a neat problem that seems complex but has a very simple, elegant solution once you see the core idea.

### Clarify the Goal

The task is to find the minimum number of moves to get a single '1' from its starting position in a 5x5 grid to the center square at `(3, 3)`. A "move" is defined as swapping any two adjacent rows or any two adjacent columns.

Think of it like a sliding puzzle. You have a 5x5 board with one special tile, and you can slide entire rows or columns one step at a time. The goal is to move the special tile to the center in the fewest slides.

### The Analogy First: The Lost Tourist in a City Grid üèôÔ∏è

Imagine you're a tourist in a city like Manhattan, laid out in a perfect grid. Your hotel is at the city center: the corner of **3rd Avenue and 3rd Street**. You find yourself lost at some other corner, say **1st Avenue and 5th Street**.

You need to find the shortest walking distance back to your hotel. Since you can't cut diagonally through buildings, you must walk along the streets. The path is simple:

  * **Avenue Distance (East/West):** To get from 1st Avenue to 3rd Avenue, you need to walk `|1 - 3| = 2` blocks.
  * **Street Distance (North/South):** To get from 5th Street to 3rd Street, you need to walk `|5 - 3| = 2` blocks.

The total minimum distance is just the sum of these two: `2 + 2 = 4` blocks.

In our problem, swapping adjacent columns is like walking one block east/west, and swapping adjacent rows is like walking one block north/south. The problem is just asking for this total "city block" distance, also known as the **Manhattan Distance**.

### The Optimal Approach (The "Aha\!" Moment)

The "Lost Tourist" analogy is the optimal approach. The "Aha\!" moment is realizing that moving rows doesn't affect the column of the '1', and moving columns doesn't affect its row. The two are completely independent\!

This means we can break the problem down into two tiny, separate questions:

1.  How many row swaps are needed? This is simply the distance from the current row (`r`) to the target row (3), which is `|r - 3|`.
2.  How many column swaps are needed? This is the distance from the current column (`c`) to the target column (3), which is `|c - 3|`.

The total minimum moves is just the sum of these two values.

Let's trace the first example where the '1' is at row 2, column 5:

  * Current location `(r, c)` is `(2, 5)`.
  * Target location is `(3, 3)`.
  * **Row moves needed:** `|2 - 3| = 1`.
  * **Column moves needed:** `|5 - 3| = 2`.
  * **Total minimum moves:** `1 + 2 = 3`.

### Code Implementation

The code for this is very straightforward. We just need to find the location of the '1' and apply our simple formula.

```python
def solve():
    """
    Solves the "Beautiful Matrix" problem from Codeforces.
    """
    row_of_one = -1
    col_of_one = -1

    # Read the 5x5 matrix and find the coordinates of the '1'.
    # We use 1-based indexing to match the problem statement.
    for i in range(1, 6):
        row = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for j in range(1, 6):
            if row[j-1] == 1:
                row_of_one = i
                col_of_one = j
                break
        if row_of_one != -1: # Optimization: stop if we found the '1'
            # We need to consume the rest of the input lines even if we found the 1
            for _ in range(5 - i):
                input()
            break

    # Calculate the Manhattan Distance to the center (3, 3).
    row_moves = abs(row_of_one - 3)
    col_moves = abs(col_of_one - 3)

    # The total moves is the sum of row and column moves.
    total_moves = row_moves + col_moves
    print(total_moves)

solve()
```

### Complexity Analysis

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$
    The program always reads a fixed 5x5 grid (25 integers) and performs a constant number of calculations. The runtime doesn't change with different inputs.

  * **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    We only store a few variables to hold the coordinates and the input row. The memory usage is constant.

### Final Check

This problem, which seems to be about matrix manipulations, beautifully simplifies to calculating the Manhattan Distance. Does this "Lost Tourist" analogy make the solution feel clear and intuitive?
